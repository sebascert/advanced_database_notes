# Instructions

You want to improve and automate the House-o-Pets database system by adding
some triggers that work with the pet care log. You want to automate the
database so that it fills in the user and date when someone inserts a record
into the table. You also want to allow users only to update records that they
created. An update on someone else’s record will fail. And finally, you want to
allow only the manager to delete records from the log. Anyone else's attempt to
delete a record, even a record created by the user, will fail. The three
triggers will be: Create a trigger that fires before inserting each row in the
PET_CARE_LOG table. The trigger will assign the current data and time to the
UPDATE_DATE column. It will also assign the current user to the UPDATED_BY_USER
column. Use pseudocolumns to get the values that you need. Handle all errors in
one general exception handler and send an error message using the
RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR procedure. Create a trigger that fires before updating
each row of the PET_CARE_LOG table. This trigger will look at the current user
and compare it with the value in the UPDATED_BY_USER column. If the two are the
same, the update proceeds. If they are different, the update raises an
exception and fails. Handle any other database errors the same way you did in
the insert trigger. Create a trigger that fires before any row is deleted from
the PET_CARE_LOG table. This trigger looks at the user who is deleting the row.
If the user is ‘JOEMANAGER,’ the delete continues successfully. Otherwise, the
delete fails and sends an error message. Handle any other database errors the
same way you did in the insert trigger.
